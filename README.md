# Ellipfit

I have a decade-old elliptical that I use almost every day. It doesn't have any fancy features that we see in today's high-tech ellipticals.

It has a device that shows the kilometers, calories burned, and duration. The calories burned are far less than what Apple watch shows. (as Apple watch also takes heart rate and other factors into consideration)

I want a simple, straightforward app to log these values daily and later on form a graph out of it.

This app is based on the tutorial written by me on LogRocket - [Understanding the SwiftUI grid layout](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-the-swiftui-grid-layout/)
